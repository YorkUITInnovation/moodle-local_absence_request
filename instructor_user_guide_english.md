Instructor User Guide: Absence Reporting in eClass

### Receiving Absence Notifications

When a student reports an absence for a course you teach:

1. You will receive an email notification with:
   - Student information
   - Absence dates and duration
   - Type of circumstance (illness, bereavement, etc.)
   - A link to view the full absence report

2. These notifications are sent to your eClass registered email address
   - Ensure your email settings are up to date in your eClass profile
   - Check your spam/junk folder if you're missing notifications

3. You can also review the notifications in the "Alerts" icon in the top navigation bar
   - Click the Alerts icon to see all recent notifications, including reported absences
